## Overview

My motivation for creating JAKYM came from my wish to create an application, that I could use to play music comfortably from the command line. I often play games and listen to music simultaneously, but using either Spotify or playing music in a browser takes a lot of resources from both my CPU and RAM.

I spent a lot of time looking through numerous CLI based music players, but they either require setting up a bunch of things, or required premium features to function; sometimes they didn't work at all, even after tinkering for hours.

Hence, instead of tearing my eyes out looking for a solution, I thought that I could code it myself.

So I present to you JAKYM, or "Just Another Konsole YouTube-Music": a command-line Youtube music player, written in Python with both Spotify and Youtube playlist support, easy on both memory and CPU resources.

## Usage

### Using Command Line Options

- Run it by using jakym command ``` jakym ```.You can also specify arguments to easily play a playlist or song. The available options can be seen via ```jakym -h```
- Use ```jakym -s "link"``` or ```jakym -y "link"``` to instanly start up by queuing a playlist without having to use the command window.
- You can also use ```jakym -p "song 1" "song 2" "song 3"``` to queue up multiple songs.
- To instantly queue a saved jakym playlist run ```jakym -l playlistpath playlistname```.
- This will launch into jakym command window.

### Using Jakym Command Window

- The program opens up into the jakym command window.
- Use ```commands``` to view all available commands.
- Enter a songname in command window to search for song or just enter its youtube link to play directly from a link.
- Jakym will queue the song once you type it and allow you to add the next song.
- The queue operates independent of the command window and plays the song on a separate thread.
- To exit the command window and hence the application simply type ```exit```.

#### Commands

- Type ```spotify``` to play music using spotify playlist
- Type ```youtube``` to play music using youtube playlist
- Use ```rm``` to remove the last queued song from the playlist.
- Type ```shuffle``` to shuffle your queue.
- Use ```load``` to load a playlist and ```save``` to save your playlist. Include the trailing slash in path i.e. specify path as ```C:\Users\Lex\Music\``` or ```/home/lex/Projects/jakym/```.
- Use ```play``` , ```pause```, ```next```, ```back``` to control the playback.
- Use ```repeat all```, ```repeat song``` and ```repeat off```to control song repetition.
- Use ```seek``` with an integer like 10 or -10 to control the current song.

## Installation

For Arch Linux users, jakym is available in the AUR. Simply use your favourate helper to get it.

To Update jakym simply run ```pip install --upgrade jakym```

### Installing ffmpeg

ffmpeg is required for this program to work correctly. Install ffmpeg by following these steps:

- On Linux - <https://www.tecmint.com/install-ffmpeg-in-linux/>
- On Windows - <https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows>

### Installing simpleaudio

simpleaudio is an optional pydub dependency, however it is essential for proper working of jakym as the playback depends on simpleaudio.

#### On Linux

- Install Dependencies by ```sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev libasound2-dev```
- Install with: ```pip install simpleaudio```

#### On Windows

- Download the .whl file of simpleaudio from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#simpleaudio)
- Once downloaded, it can be installed using the following command : ```pip install package_name.whl```

### Installing jakym

- Install by using pypi :-``` pip install jakym ```

- Run using jakym command ``` jakym ```

Violla jakym is now installed!

Enjoy jakym

## How It Works

- The program starts and runs two threads, one to input music into the playlist and the other to iterate over the playlist, download the corresponding music and play it.
- The yt-dlp library does most of the heavy lifting of both parsing links and downloading them into a suitable file format.
- The pydub and simpleaudio libraries provide cross-platform audio playback without any issues but setting up simpleaudio on windows and Linux take a different approach.
- The program runs until user types exit.
